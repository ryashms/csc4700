Didn't Cha Know


Lyrics
Oh-oh-oh-oh hey, yeah
Ooh-oh
Ahh-ah
Uhh-uh
Ayy-ay
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
I think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
I think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
Tried to move, but I lost my way
Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
Stopped to watch my emotions sway
Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
Knew the toll, but I would not pay
Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
That you never know where the cards may lay
Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?
So many things I still don't know
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path
I know my heart will guide me back
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
I think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey, uh-ooh
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
I think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
Tried to run, but I lost my way
Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
Stopped to watch my emotions sway
Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
Knew the toll, but I would not pay
Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
I said ya never know how the cards may lay
Love is life and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day
Love is life and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day
Love is life and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day
